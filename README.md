# BrownianMotionVisualization

A standard (one-dimensional) Wiener process (also called Brownian motion) is
a stochastic process {Wt}t≥0+ indexed by nonnegative real numbers t with the following
properties:
(1) W0 = 0.
(2) With probability 1, the function t → Wt is continuous in t.
(3) The process {Wt}t≥0 has stationary, independent increments.
(4) The increment Wt+s − Ws has the NORMAL(0, t) distribution.
